### Hi mates ðŸ‘‹

(bio under construction)

Welcome to my profile :D. I'm a begginer programmer interested in front development, now working with RoboHelp in a machinery manufacturing company.
So, I'm spending my time at the office creating new layouts with HTML, Css and a bit of Javascript.
Now I'm very interested in create new web sites and web apps while I'm studiying TI development.

I would like to help and collaborate on open source projects.

Nice to meet you!
